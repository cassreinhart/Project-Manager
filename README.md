## 1. Set Up Virtual Environment
After cloning the repo, you will need to set up a virtual environment and install dependencies for the application to run locally.
- In the local repository, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
- Ensure you have postgres up and running locally. Then enter `createdb projectstest` to create the database.

## 2. Run Development Site
- Use `FLASK_ENV=development flask run` to run on port 5000.
- Visit [localhost](https://localhost:5000) to navigate to development site.
